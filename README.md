This is a python script that I used on an EC2 instance and a local computer to send images from the local device to the instance.
The server is ran on the EC2 instance(main.py) and the images are sent from the local device (client.py).

Steps to run:
1. Run main
2. Run client

Notes:
For the EC2 instance you will want to use the private ip value, whereas for the local device you will use the public IP for the EC2 instance
